# nab-comportex

Support and experiments for running
[Comportex](https://github.com/htm-community/comportex) HTM models on
the [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark](https://github.com/numenta/NAB).

For context, read the blog post
[Attempting the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark](http://floybix.github.io/2016/07/01/attempting-nab).

## Results

The results as submitted to the
[2016 NAB Competition](http://numenta.org/nab/) can be found in the
`results` directory.

## Usage

To reproduce the results submitted to the
[2016 NAB Competition](http://numenta.org/nab/):

1. install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).
2. clone this git repo. It should be placed alongside the `NAB`
   directory so that data files can be read from and result files
   written to `../NAB`.
3. In the `NAB` directory:
  * `python scripts/create_new_detector.py --detector comportexDepth1GlobalFrac16Stim18`
  * `python scripts/create_new_detector.py --detector comportexDepth1GlobalFrac16Stim18NoDelta`
  * `python scripts/create_new_detector.py --detector comportexDepth1EfftGlobalFrac16Stim18`
4. In the `nab-comportex` directory:
  * `lein repl`
5. In the repl: `(start-notebook)`
6. Note the port number such as 12345, then go to
   http://localhost:12345/worksheet.html?filename=worksheeets/method.clj
7. Keep pressing Shift+Enter...

The results will be written into `../NAB/results/`.

It would also be possible to run the clojure file
`worksheets/method.clj` in other ways, interactive or not.
